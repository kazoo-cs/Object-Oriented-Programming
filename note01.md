## Object
#### In CS
Can be a _variable_, a _data structure_, a _function_, or a _method_  
Has a value that can be referenced by an _identifier_  
#### In OOP
It is an _instance_ of a _class_ where the object can be any of the mentioned above  
Data and functional code merged
- States; characteristics that identifies the object
- Behaviour; possible functionality of the object
```python
class Dog #this is an OBJECT
    def __init__(self,name,colour,breed):
        #Below are examples of ATTRIBUTES
        self.name = name
        self.colour = colour
        self.breed = breed
        self.is_hungry = False
        self.is_thirsty = True
        
    def bark(self): #This is a METHOD
        return "woof"
    
    def eat(self,food): #This is also a METHOD
        return f'{self.name} ate {food}!"
```
## Object Oriented Programming
Used to create 'modular reusable software programs'  
They use *objects*  
#### Procedure-Oriented programming (input -> process -> output)  
- Calculations  
- Logical  
- Repetitive  
#### OOP (definition of data)
- What is the name?
- What is the colour?
- What is the size?  

Aim to create objects that can define and use to solve problems  
## Class
Class is essentially a blueprint, an outline, or a template for the object(s).  
A class should contain attributes and methods  
```python
class Test: #This is how a class is initialized
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name #This is an attribute
        
    def yell(self): #This is a method
        return f'{self.name} yelled ???' 
```

## Attributes
Attributes are variables that exist in the class or an object  
They must be initialized under the \_\_init\_\_ method and have values given beforehand or by the user
```python
class Phone:
    def __init__(self,name,brand,battery,age):
        '''
        Attributes below are initialized based on the object initialization. 
        self.status is already given the value 'Stable'
        '''
        self.name = name
        self.brand = brand
        self.battery = battery
        self.age = age
        self.status = 'Stable'
```
## Methods
Methods are the class's/object's callable functions  
They must always have 'self' as the first argument  
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self,name,age,number,address): #Example
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.number = number
        self.address = address
        
    def birthday(self): #Another example. For methods to function, they will need self.
        return f'Happy birthday {self.name}! You are now {self.age + 1} years old!'
```

## Encapsulation
Protecting information  
Can hide certain attributes and methods  
In python, use double underscore '__' as prefix  
```python
class Test:
    def __init__(self,name,s_num):
        self.__name = name #Encapsulation
        self.__s_num = s_num #Another encapsulation
```
## Polymorphism
Method available for any class and parameter-dependent objects   
Poly -> Many  
Morohism -> Forms  
Ex.  
Two *independent* classes can have the *same* method  
A method can be used throughout *inherited* classes  
### Overloading
Type of *Polymorphism*  
Two methods within a *single class* with *identical* method names but *different* parameters  
This **does not** work in Python 3  
### Override
Type of *Polymorphism*  
Two methods with *identical* method names *and* parameters  
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self,name,breed,weight):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.weight = weight
        
     def eat(self): #This is an example of overriding
        return f'{self.name} is now full'
   
class Cat:
    def __init__(self,name,breed,weight):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.weight = weight
        
    def eat(self): #This is the pair that proves overriding
        return f'{self.name} is now full'
```
## Inheritance
Occurs when an *object* or *class* is based on *another* class, a *parent* class.  
An inherited class would contain *attributes and methods* that belongs in the parent class.  
### Single Inheritance 
*Subclass* inheriting from a *single* parent class
### Multiple Inheritance
*Subclass* inherting from *multiple* parent classes
### Multilevel Inheritance
*Subclass* inheriting from *another* subclass
